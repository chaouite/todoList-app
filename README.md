# ToDo List Applciation

The application serves as a robust todo list manager, offering a user-friendly interface for efficient task management. Users can register and log in. Upon authentication, the <MainApp/> takes center stage, providing a comprehensive suite of features for creating, updating and deleting tasks. Tasks are organized by categories  and the users can easily navigate and prioritize their todo list. 

The system intelligently handles task order, allowing for dynamic task rearrangement and includes options to mark tasks as completed. Behind the scenes, the backend, running on http://localhost:8080/, incorporates JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, and SQLite database management for enhanced security. 

The frontend is using Vite and runs on http://localhost:5173/. By leveraging components like <Signup/> and <Login/>, users can create an account, log in and seamlessly navigate through the app to efficiently manage their todo list. The application effectively combines frontend simplicity with backend security, offering a powerful solution for streamlined and organized task management.
